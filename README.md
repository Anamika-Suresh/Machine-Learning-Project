## Machine Learning Project

**Objective**:
You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independentvariables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc., to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing
dynamics of a new market.

### STEPS:

***- 1. Loading and Preprocessing : Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.***

***- 2. Model Implementation***

 ● Linear Regression
 
 ● Decision Tree Regressor
 
 ● Random Forest Regressor
 
 ● Gradient Boosting Regressor
 
 ● Support Vector Regressor

***- 3.Model Evaluation:Compare the performance of all the models based on R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Identify the best performing model and justify why it is the best.***

***- 4.Feature Importance Analysis: Identify the significant variables affecting car prices (feature selection).***

***- 5. Hyperparameter Tuning (2 marks): Perform hyperparameter tuning and check whether the performance of the model has increased.***
